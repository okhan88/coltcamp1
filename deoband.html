        <h2>Deoband Poem</h2>
        <p>
            Before we raise our tongues at their views, <br>
            Let us recall we are not worthy to touch their shoes. <br>
            Who are we to really pick and choose? <br>
            Their nights in Ibadah, they woke-out nights we snore and snooze <br>

        <p> Ali Thanwi (1862–1943) often referred to honorifically as <b>Ḥakīm al-Ummat</b>, was a central figure of
            Islamic
            religious, spiritual, and intellectual life in late-nineteenth- and twentieth-century South Asia and
            continues
            to be highly influential today.<sup>[2]</sup> He was an author, jurist and a Sufi mentor of the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chishti_Order">Chishti order</a>. He was an
            alumnus of the Darul Uloom Deoband, and authored several hundred books including Bayan Ul Quran and Bahishti
            Zewar. His reworking of traditional Islamic knowledge and spiritualization of Shariah to make it accessible
            to
            the common people had a direct impact on modern Islam. Thus Tablighi Jamaat, the chief transnational Islamic
            movement with between 100 and 150 million followers that leads the spiritual education of ordinary Muslims,
            is
            considerably inspired by His writings and activities.[3] </p>

            <h2>Opposition by Barelvis</h2>
            <p>Deobandi elders, including those accused in the Fatwa, prepared a reply to questions sent to them by the
                scholars
                of Hijaz to clarify the matter. Thus, Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri's al-Muhannad 'ala al-Mufannad (The Sword on
                the
                Disproved), was written in Arabic and signed by all Deobandi scholars including Ashraf Ali
                Thanvi.[9][10][11]
                Thanwi's disciple Murtaza Hasan Chandpuri also wrote articles and leaflets in defence of Thanw</p>

        <h2>Teachings</h2>
        <h3> what he taught </h3>
        <h4>more of what he taught</h4>
        <h5> he was a sufi</h5>
        <h6>he was a chishti</h6>
        <p>Ashraf Ali Thanvi stressed on adopting the complete way of Islam to attain salvation. He shunned those Sufis
            who
            stressed on voluntary worshiping but neglected other important commandments of Islam including fair dealings
            and
            fulfilling the rights of others. Thus his stress would be more on the basic personal reformation and the
            prescription of Wazaif would come later</p>
