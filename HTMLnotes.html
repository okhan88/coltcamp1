Section 3:HTML the Essentials

HTML is the content/structure of the page

HTML- HyperText Markup Language

common elements:

<p> element represents a paragraph of text
<h1> elemrent represents the main header on a page
<img> embeds an image
<form> represents a form

these need to be on every HTML page!!!

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>
</head>
<body>
     content goes here 
</body>
</html>
--------------------------------------------

Section 4: HTML next steps

<div> helps group things in a block

<span> is a generic element that is in line, does not take its own line/block

both div and span are used primarily alongside CSS (will be learned later)

<hr> element makes a line across the screen. Break between text. Does not have a closing tag

<br> is a line break. Used primarily for poems and removes the need to add new paragraph elements

<sup> superscript

<sub> subscript

HTML entities
    start with an ampersand & and end with a semicolon :
    used to display reversed characters, that normally would be invalic
    also used in place of difficult to type characters
    the browser interprets them and renders the correct character instead

    these are things like less than symbols, spades, hearts, snowmans, etc


semantic markup- meaningful markups for elements. Instead of divs, you can use

    <section> - standalone section
    <article> - 
    <nav> - anything on page that provides navigation to the same or different pages
    <main> - this si the main content of the page 
    <header> - intro content of a page
    <footer> - footer of page
    <aside> - sidebars or call out boxes
    <summary>
    <details>
