Section 3:HTML the Essentials

HTML is the content/structure of the page

HTML- HyperText Markup Language

common elements:

<p> element represents a paragraph of text
<h1> elemrent represents the main header on a page
<img> embeds an image
<form> represents a form

these need to be on every HTML page!!!

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>
</head>
<body>
     content goes here 
</body>
</html>
--------------------------------------------

Section 4: HTML next steps

<div> helps group things in a block

<span> is a generic element that is in line, does not take its own line/block

both div and span are used primarily alongside CSS (will be learned later)

<hr> element makes a line across the screen. Break between text. Does not have a closing tag

<br> is a line break. Used primarily for poems and removes the need to add new paragraph elements

<sup> superscript

<sub> subscript

HTML entities
    start with an ampersand & and end with a semicolon :
    used to display reversed characters, that normally would be invalic
    also used in place of difficult to type characters
    the browser interprets them and renders the correct character instead

    these are things like less than symbols, spades, hearts, snowmans, etc


semantic markup- meaningful markups for elements. Instead of divs, you can use

    <section> - standalone section
    <article> - 
    <nav> - anything on page that provides navigation to the same or different pages
    <main> - this si the main content of the page 
    <header> - intro content of a page
    <footer> - footer of page
    <aside> - sidebars or call out boxes
    <summary>
    <details>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 4: HTML next steps and semantics

table elements:
        <table>
        <td>
        <tr>
        <th>
        <thead>
        <tbody>
        <tfoot>
        <colgroup>
        <caption>

most important table elements are td, tr, and th

form elements:
            need the <form>, <id>, <label>,

CSS notes

cascading style sheets- language describing how documents are presented visually

CSS follows this basic patter:
        selector {
            property: value;
        }

example:
        h1 {
            color: purple;
        }


CSS has a ton of more properties compared to HTML, but you do not to memorize all of them

when preparing separate documents for HTML and CSS, on the HTML doc you need to include the <link> element and for the href, you type in the name of the CSS file

section 7


ID selector- if an element has an id named "logout", you can specifically style it like this:
        #logout {
            color: green
        }

Class selector- if an element has a class named "complete", you can specifically style it like this:

        .complete {
            color:green
        }

descendant selector- for example, you want to select all <a>'s that are nested inside an <li>:
        li a {
            color: green
        }
    this will select all anchor tags found within an <li>


adjacent selector- if you want to specifcially customize an element that comes after another element, use this. For example, if you want only the buttons after an h2 to be black, do this:
        h2 + button {
            color: black;
        }


attribute selector- use this in order to select elements based on certain type. For example, if you are only trying to select elements with the type "text", do this:

        input[type="text"] {
            color: green
        }

pseudo classes- keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). need to include a colon before the keyowrd. Some examples of keywords:
        :active
        :hover
        :checked
        :not()
        :nth-child()
